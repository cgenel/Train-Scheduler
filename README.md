# Train-Scheduler
> This is my first attempt at coding a Train Scheduler Application

## Table of Contents
* A Train Scheduler Application 
- index.html
- app.js
- style.css

## General Info
This is a train scheduler application that uses Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

To-do- list:
* Need to finish all of the javascript
* I have created a Firebase project for hw but need to finish incorporating it into the application
* I need to get the train information to display in the empty Current Train Schedule section

##Status
Project is: _in progress_
